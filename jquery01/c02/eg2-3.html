                grep(array, callback, boolean)
                1. array
                is the original array that is passed to this method for performing filtering tasks on it.
                2. callback 
                is the function that performs filtering tasks and returns the values that
                make up the filtered array. This function can carry two parameters; one is the
                array element and the second is the index value.
                3. boolean 
                is usually omitted. If it is specified and is set to false (which is the
                default), then it has no effect, but if its value is set to true, then the operation of
                the callback function is inverted. That is, it will return the values that do not match
                the conditional statements present in the callback function.
